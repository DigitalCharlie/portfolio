In addition, I managed the development of a distributed organizing system that empowered activists to find people who shared interests, geographies, identities and skillsets and work together. <br /><br />
		
		In all, over 300,000 people marched in New York, and thousands of events were heard worldwide. The march was mentioned multiple times on the floor of the UN during the meeting, and at the time was by far the largest climate march in history.`,
